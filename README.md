# Thesis Trend Visualization System using TF-IDF Algorithm and Cosine Similarity Validation

Welcome to the Thesis Trend Visualization System repository! This repository provides code and guidelines for building a system that visualizes trends in academic theses using the TF-IDF algorithm and validates them using cosine similarity.

# Description

The Thesis Trend Visualization System employs the TF-IDF algorithm to analyze and extract keywords from academic theses, enabling the visualization of trends over time. Moreover, the system validates the extracted trends using cosine similarity, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the identified trends.

# User Guide

Here's how to use the Skripsi Trend Visualization System:

1. Prerequisite Installation: Ensure Python and required libraries are installed, such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and others. You can install them using the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Data Preparation: Provide a dataset containing thesis titles and descriptions in a Excel file format.

3. Code Execution: Run the trend_visualization.py file to initiate the trend visualization system. The code will analyze the dataset, extract trends, and create visualizations.

4. Validation: The system validates trends using cosine similarity to ensure their accuracy.

# Repository Structure

`repo_lite_completed.ipynb`: Main code for running the trend visualization and validation system.

`requirements.txt`: List of required libraries to run the code.

`stopwords.txt`: List of stopwords used for text preprocessing.

Please note that this repository does not include the actual skincare product data files due to privacy considerations. You will need to provide your own dataset containing product descriptions and information for the system to work properly.
